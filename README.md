Here, I use Markov Chains to predict Thalassemia

To curtail the spread of Thalassemia, one way is to select an appropriate spouse that has no sign of any traits of thalassemia, even if you have major/minor traits, chances are your child may not inherit thalassemia. If both the parents have major thalassemia traits, then there is a full chance that the child will also inherit the same.

Markov process is a stochastic process having the property that, given its present state, the future states are independent of the past. That is, the future, which is the next generation will be determined by the current generation. The probability distribution model will be modelled based on this Markov's process. Thus, through this, we can find the probability of different generation of a family being affected by thalassemia, the lower incidence genotype will be inherited and the transmission will be controlled. Lower incidence category means that the traits of thalassemia inherited are not severe and no remarkable symptoms are observed. Whereas, in higher incidence category, the disease will be severe and all symptoms will be fairly visible.
